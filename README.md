## About

Welcome to the repository for our final group project in my Intro to C/C++ course! ðŸŽ‰ In this project, we've endeavored to replicate a classic and humorous game known as "MadLibs" using the C/C++ programming languages.

### What is MadLibs?
MadLibs are stories with words removed and replaced by blank spaces. Theyâ€™re typically printed out on paper and manually filled in. Our group wanted to create a Mad Libs-inspired program in C++. Our finishing program offers a modern twist on this admired game. In the program, we expand the interactivity aspect of Mad Libs by creating user input options for the blanks as well as input options for the story genre and user editing control after the program output.

### Our Project:
In this repository, you'll find our implementation of MadLibs in C/C++. We've aimed to capture the essence of the original game while introducing modern features to enhance the user experience.

### Features:
- **Interactive Stories:** Our program offers four story options: comedy, romance, horror, and mystery. You can choose your preferred genre to personalize your MadLibs experience.
- **User Input Options:** You'll be prompted to enter two adjectives, two nouns, two verbs, and two places, with the option to choose from pre-selected words or enter your own.
- **User Editing Control:** After the program outputs the selected story with your chosen words, you have the option to make changes and receive a new story with your updated choices.

### How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C/C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable file to start playing MadLibs!
