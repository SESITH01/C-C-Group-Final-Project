Mad Libs are stories with words removed and replaced by blank spaces. They’re typically printed out on paper and manually filled in. Our group wanted to create a Mad Libs-inspired program in C++. Our finishing program offers a modern twist on this admired game. In the program, we expand the interactivity aspect of Mad Libs by creating user input options for the blanks as well as input options for the story genre and user editing control after the program output. 

When you run the program, you are presented with four story options: comedy, romance, horror, and mystery. Then, you are prompted to enter two adjectives, two nouns, two verbs, and two places. You have the option to either choose from pre-selected words in a word bank or enter your own words. The program will then output the selected story with your selected words, and you have the option to make changes. If you select “Yes” you will go through each word choice again and receive a new story with your updated changes.
